**The Change Lab @ Stanford, directed by Professor Nilam Ram, studies change and attempts to invoke change.**

**We study how people change, how media change, how the world changes, and how all those changes interact and influence each other over time. We develop novel techniques for measuring change (often using mobile technologies), cool data visualizations (and sonifications), and novel methods for analysis of longitudinal data. We occasionally forward new theory about the dynamics ofÂ  human behavior and human interaction.**

**We are often engaged in analyzing the large repositories of smartphone data collected in the [Human Screenome Project](screenomics.stanford.edu).**
